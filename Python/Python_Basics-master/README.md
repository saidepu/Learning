:warning: :warning: I'm archiving this repo, as I don't intend to work on this repo further.

I'm re-using materials in this repo for the **100 Page Python Intro** book (https://github.com/learnbyexample/100_page_python_intro).

I'm also working on **Practice Python Projects** book (https://github.com/learnbyexample/practice_python_projects), which I had intended in this repo for the `mini_projects` folder.
